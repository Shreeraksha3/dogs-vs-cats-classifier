# 🐾 Dogs vs Cats Image Classifier

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images of **dogs** and **cats**.

## 📁 Contents

- `Dog_vs_Cat.ipynb` – Model training code  
- `Dog_vs_cat_test.ipynb` – Notebook to load the model and test with images  
- `dogs_vs_cats_cnn_model.keras` – Saved trained model  

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the test notebook in Colab
2. Upload an image or use the test set
3. Load the saved model
4. Get predictions: 🐶 or 🐱

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib / NumPy

## ✨ Result

After 10 epochs of training with data augmentation, the model can predict cats and dogs with decent accuracy.



📌 This is a beginner-friendly deep learning project suitable for portfolios and interviews.
